    The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) defines a comprehensive vocabulary and a readable XML markup syntax for
    documenting research data. It is in widespread use in the earth and environmental sciences, and increasingly
    in other research disciplines as well. EML is a community-maintained specification, and evolves to meet the data
    documentation needs of researchers who want to openly document, preserve, and share data and outputs.

    EML includes modules for identifying and citing data packages, for describing the spatial, temporal, taxonomic,
    and thematic extent of data, for describing research methods and protocols, for describing the structure and
    content of data within sometimes complex packages of data, and for precisely annotating data with semantic
    vocabularies. EML includes metadata fields to fully detail data papers that are published in journals specializing
    in scientific data sharing and preservation.
